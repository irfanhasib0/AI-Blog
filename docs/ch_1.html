In this first chapter I will try to explain what makes me believe in God and my thoughts about His power and capabilities. Even if someone not a Muslim but curious about discovering the absolute truth might find it helpful. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter 1: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">If everyone around us shares the same blessing, &nbsp;sometimes we fail to perceive its importance. Imagine a world with half of its people with one eye and the others with two eyes. How lucky and blessed the people with two eyes would feel ? Just extrapolate this thought for every other blessing we inherit as a human on this earth. We have an entire life, how much of it are we willing to allocate for showing our thankfulness ?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">If we keep receiving a favor for a very long time we start thinking it to be granted and forget how much we needed it. Mothers cook you breakfast everyday in most of the families, most of us would care least about it. It becomes apparent when it is gone. The nice people among us don&#39;t wait for it to disappear to express gratitude. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">An oppressor living a heavenly life while the oppressed one suffers till death. A sincere soul should always be bothered with it. It might be even aggravated, if there is no one to do justice at the end. What makes us think that we deserve justice ? Probably a short answer would not suffice here, let&rsquo;s go through the later section.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">It seems to me that gratitude and empathy are two of the driving forces that may lead many of us to dive deeper in pursuit of the truth. Nothing can bring more peace in our hearts than the truth.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Perfection on the Blind Spot</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Nobody can overlook the essence of balance and perfection in the world, especially each of their necessity for our sustenance. Nearly 70% of the &nbsp;earth is ocean. Unfortunately, we cannot drink any of it . The sea water is purified through rain, stored beneath the land. From the top of the mountain gigantic flow of sweet water runs across the rivers spreading towards the farthest &nbsp;lands. Most of the water on earth is salty, still such a powerful purification system ! Seems like a colossal water piping system embedded within the lands. In modern cities there are well planned distribution systems for sending water to every house. At an enormous scale rivers are distributing water to every civilization.</span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The main source of energy to the earth is the sun. &nbsp;Everything we do requires energy. Science tells us energy cannot be created, it can be transformed from one form to another. Let&#39;s look at where we humans are receiving our energy from. The trees that stand all day receive sunlight, do photosynthesis, produce fruits and grain for us. We collect them from the tree and our body breaks it down to produce calories so that we can walk and breathe. What a nice system for extracting energy from the sun thus fueling our every action &nbsp;! We don&#39;t even need to stand like the trees to get sunlight. Trees are doing it for us. Everywhere on earth they are present for humans, just like filling stations for cars metaphorically.</span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The trees absorb CO2 and give us Oxygen. Wherever we travel through the land we basically swim in a sea of oxygen just like fishes swim in the river of water. Trees are preparing them continuously for us. We don&#39;t need to worry while taking a heavy breath, there is always a continuous supply of oxygen. Think about living on Mars with an oxygen tank in your back. Without such a sustainable cycle we would be no more than a fish out of water.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">At every aspect of life we are finding the things we expect i.e water , food , air . Probably, it all together enforces our belief on someone who will make everything right. We can feel the necessity of the supreme provider who has arranged the earth for us with everything &nbsp;but a fair life within the earthly span. </span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Signature of Wisdom</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Just within the human body there can be thousands of examples for perfection. Imagine the heart stops pumping for a while or the lungs stops purifying your blood for some time. The brain, heart, lungs, lever, kidney each of them are a much more sophisticated machine then any state of the earth invention of today. How are they working so perfectly without any planner or sustainer ? We can observe m</span><span class="c4">i</span><span class="c6">croevolution in nature. Only a wise planner can create things that can perfect itself with time. For example - a robot learns to walk using AI. It required lots of years for the greatest scientists of time to make such a thing to work. Lot&rsquo;s of research and planning involved in the process. If someone extrapolates it up to m</span><span class="c4">a</span><span class="c6">croevolution i.e a cell appears by random interaction of chemicals in nature and everything comes from it through evaluation. Basically it tries to claim every living being is created without any intelligent planner. Let&rsquo;s restrict ourselves in the realm of human inventions for a while. Something a little bit similar to microevolution required brilliant minds to work for years (AI based learning robots). It&rsquo;s more of a common sense that a design that can improve or enhance itself requires a lot more intelligence than the typical ones. An invention that just gets created by itself brick by brick automatically, without a single human intervention may require supreme advancement in science and technology. For the sake of argument, imagine the human race has reached that kind of peak in terms of science. They are now able to create an atomic robot without any physical intervention (just putting some chemicals in the right place and controlling the heat, air etc around it from a remote place). Humans then just vanished to another planet without any trace of their existence. The atomic robot is quite an advanced technology to grow itself and gets its capability enhanced by interacting with nature. Then an alien creature reached the planet and discovered these amazing robots. After lots of research they found that the robots came by themselves (since there is no trace of their creation). How does it sound ? If you cannot find proof for anything that can also mean someone a lot smarter than you just removed all the traces. This is a quite logical possibility. </span><span class="c3 c9">If someone eliminates this possibility then he is just acting out of arrogance. What can make someone eliminate this possibility completely? I am leaving this question for the readers.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">God can create Adam and insert him on earth in such a manner that it will completely match the existing human race chromosome by chromosome. If God made it too obvious then there would be no test for humans.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">All that being said, why does God remove every direct proof but he left lots of signs that would make humans think of him ? There can be two possible reasons - (a) he doesn&#39;t want us to discover him. (b) He wants to test - whoever tries to find him although He can not be seen . Why would we try to find God ? (i) Out for our gratitude after observing the perfection in the universe. (ii) If there is no God the worldly life would bother every sincere soul (iii) There can be many other reasons, God knows the best. When we feel very weak, &nbsp;from the inside we have an urge to expect justice from a far greater Deity. Why do we expect a powerful Deity ? By observing the &nbsp;excellence in every creation around us. We want to be grateful to the one who created us, provided us with so many blessings and we would ask absolute justice to him only because he only has that capability. We can&#39;t stop expecting from him so we just will feel the urge to search for him. Since he has hidden himself but he created the urge within us to find him, after that we can only expect some message of hope from him. To the pious ones those are the revelations from our lord.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">*** If God left just one direct proof then there was no option to doubt his existence. It would not be a test anymore. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">*** If someone could ever observe an animal being created by God, he would never accept that it can come out naturally. Just like we know how humans make a digital camera so if someone shows me a camera lying on Mars I would simply think someone just left it here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">*** The beginning / cause</span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The more we are observing the more it reveals the necessity of its planner. Protons and electrons are staying perfectly balanced resulting in stable atoms. Why are they even obeying the law of physics ? Atoms are &nbsp;bonding themselves by creating quiet molecules of water, oxygen, amino acid, glucose, human cell, organ, and the brain.</span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c7">The Invisible Sustainer </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The more we observe the universe the more we discover laws and order. Based on our intelligence we can explain some things around us. Does it mean humans will be able to explain everything with time ? Human brain has a limited number of neurons which means limited analytical capacity. It&#39;s quite rational to assume that there would be so much knowledge in the universe that our brain will never be able to process let alone understand them. &nbsp;Who is making the universe obey the rules ? We just observe the world, the reality around us and discover rules like F = ma. Who makes the &nbsp;acceleration to be proportional to force and not F = m*sqrt(a) or F = m*a^2 instead ? I wonder if there is a universe with F = ma^0 where motion would be absurd ! Who is making the universe follow these specific rules every moment ? Why do they never change? It&rsquo;s like the universe is a perfect design with a strict manual and science is just trying to discover the manual bit by bit.</span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">It should be a scientifically accepted fact that the human brain has limited capability. Undoubtedly we have distinctive analytical skills compared to other living creatures around us. However, no researcher can ever claim that - humans will be able to perceive &ldquo;everything&rdquo;. If someone claims, he must be far from any logic rather just obsessed with humans&rsquo; analytic capability. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chain of causality</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Matter can be created &nbsp;from energy. There is no way to create energy in this universe. All of it just existed somehow !</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Human brain can deal with causality. By sticking to the chain of cause we can go up to the beginning of the universe. Who started this huge chain of cause ? There must be a beginning, an absolute reason for everything. No one can deny or come with a theory without a </span><span class="c6">biginning</span><span class="c3">. It can be pushed far and far back trillions of billions of years with additional hypotheses but it should be right there.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Theory is an approach for explaining natural phenomena. It doesn&#39;t require a visible proof. If we fell an apple it will just drop. Here comes the theory of gravitational. No scientist has ever seen gravitation , there is no sensor or goggles to observe it. We can only observe its effect. It can explain the natural phenomenon so nicely we believe it like we can just see it.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">A theory gets stronger when it can explain more facts. The theory of evolution at best can explain the existence of life forms to some extent but there is a lot beyond that. I humbly request to give the Theory of God a chance and it will practically eliminate every question we might have. What a strong theory it is, isn&rsquo;t it ? No other theory on earth can even be nearly as strong as it answering so many questions.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The only question left to be cleared is - if God is so powerful why does God allow suffering ?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">The answer varies from religion to religion, person to person. </span><span class="c6 c10">Try to explore the on</span><span class="c6">ly question left. I </span><span class="c6">believe</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;one of the existing religions / opinions will satisfy you completely. The answer of this very &nbsp;last question should make the Theory of God the most powerful one to anybody.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">As soon as we embrace the theory of God we give up the impossible attempt to be able to explain everything rather we submit to a supreme powerful Deity who possesses all the knowledge. Let me make it clear again - humans can explain something within his capability but just not everything in the universe. I am not suggesting to stop working on science and just keep believing in God. Science means observing the universe and trying to understand its rules and apply it for the greater good of humanity. I believe it would be even good in the eyes of God as long as our intention is doing good people. I am just suggesting don&rsquo;t push it too hard when we come to know our own limitations and the possibility of a supreme being. The more we explore the universe the more we will know its greatness and perfection, the more we should discover how small we know and how small we can possibly ever know. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Perceptional Limitation of Human</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">We are confined within our physical world, limited in our dimensional boundary. Imagine a 4D creature that lives beyond the three dimensions &nbsp;it would be able to go back and forth in time. It might have part of its body at this moment, part in the past and part in future. Just like we can occupy a space in 3 dimensions. Another example might make it clear - let&#39;s think of a two dimensional ant on a wall (of course hypothetical) that can not perceive beyond the plane (along the wall). If someone from our dimension (3D) crosses a door through the plane - the ant would surprisingly observe the cross-section of the person (probably his intestine and organs) instantaneously passing through it. It would never be able to picture a whole human inside its brain, a red bloody human shaped surface would be all it can observe. Some very intelligent ant from that dimension might make some imaginations of how 3D humans are actually shaped &nbsp;but that will be far from reality. The fraction of the person&#39;s body before and after the wall is just like past and future for this particular being and the portion crossing through the plane will be its present (hypothetically). Science tells us there could be much more dimensions in like 11 or 26 ! </span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Intellectual Limitation of Human</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">A processor with 100 billion transistors can be designed for a specific analytic capability. Like it would be a 16 bit or 32 bit processor. For an 8 bit computer, numbers higher than &nbsp;255 is not possible. We are all familiar with errors in calculators while multiplying very big numbers. It&#39;s not like a number that big can not be multiplied, it is just beyond the capacity of the processor of the calculator. Humans can not deny there are so many things that we will never be able to think of. Human brain has a finite number of neurons so it should have finite analytical capability.</span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">No one can see gravity but we can see its necessity, there is no doubt about the presence of a force that is pulling every mass to the center of the earth. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Whoever is just waiting for science to discover every fact and explain everything to humans, &nbsp;is just living in a very deceptive lie. They are filling the place of God with science. Science is nothing but our observation of the existing creations. At best we can create some particles from energy but energy can never be created by earthly beings. Being humble to the one who created the energy and everything around us is one of the best logical conclusions. Sticking to a lie would relieve you from searching for your Creator and let you indulge in your desires, as much as you want in whatever way you achieve it. The temptation is huge but our job is to overcome it by reasoning and knowing the greatest truth. We humans can reason animals cannot still choose a life closer to them will make our intellect useless. Deep inside us we all know the difference between right and wrong, as long as good keeps that door open for us. </span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Psychological necessity of a creator </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In this world right at this moment many people are going through unimaginable suffering. Probably many of them have no clue why they are going through these. If you are lucky enough to not be one of them you must know someone from them. Why is the suffering in some peoples life while some of them are quite innocent ? Why do some evil people live a heavenly life on this earth ? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Every sincere person whether he himself is going through a miserable life or he knows someone going through hardship. His empathy will make him wish for the existence of God. Someone as powerful as God can make everything right and provide absolute justice. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">A child might have been going through a deadly disease for a few years while it has been breathing on earth. Eventually he/she is going to die a painful death soon. Who can give it some justice ? It doesn&#39;t even know what sin is. The most powerful man on earth cannot give life back to this child. Can you look at the dying baby and live your life happily believing that there is no God ? Even a sincere person having no hardship in his own life - &nbsp;can only have some peace by believing that a &#39;Deity&#39; is up there to ensure &nbsp;justice to this dying baby. What can make the parents happy ? Is there any other option than believing in God here ?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">A nice young person just came to know he will die in a few years. He just settled down after lots of ups and downs - probably was planning to get married. He worked hard his whole life just to reach here- now he has it but the time is over ! What can bring him a little peace other than believing in God ? He is going to meet his creator - since he spent an honest life, can hope for something good in the end.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Imagine the earth with no cycle of water and limited food, lack of fresh breathable air, every living being just fighting for survival on a semi-balanced planet. It would seem like there is no balance or order here. Humans just live by chance and can get extinct any moment. Who would expect fairness on such an earth ? </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">For water, food, air it was perfectly balanced but for justice the earthly life span is not making sense. Why not extrapolate it to part of it after death and assume the same &quot;powerful source&quot; will make it balanced again who balanced water, food or O2 cycle so perfectly. </span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p></body></html>
